#gmusicapi: an unofficial Python API for Google Play Music

This project allows control of [Google Music](http://music.google.com) from Python. It is not supported nor endorsed by Google.

**Respect Google in your use of the API**. Use common sense (protocol compliance, reasonable load, etc) and don't ruin the fun for everyone else.

For those looking to use the api, see the installation and usage sections below. Documentation is hosted at Read the Docs: [documentation](http://readthedocs.org/docs/unofficial-google-music-api/en/latest).

For those looking to port or contribute, see the porting section below. There's also a code overview on the wiki: [wiki](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/wiki/Codebase-Overview).

For bugs reports, feature requests, and contributions, go ahead and [open an issue](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/issues/new).

##Usage

The API has been tested on Python 2.7.2 on Linux and Windows.

###Installation

To build from source, you'll need the following Python modules: [mutagen](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mutagen/), [validictory](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/validictory/), [protobuf](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/protobuf/), [decorator](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/), [chardet](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet/).

If you're not comfortable installing from source:

* Linux users: use `pip install gmusicapi` to get the most recent version and dependencies.

* Windows users: there is an [installation binary on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmusicapi/).

To upload filetypes other than mp3, you're going to need FFmpeg installed and in your system path. For Ubuntu users: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg ubuntu-restricted-extras`. Windows users, get [the most recent static binaries](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and then [edit your path](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) to include the directory that contains ffmpeg.exe.

To check that everything is set up correctly, you can run the test suite: `python -m gmusicapi.test.integration_test_api`. If something goes wrong during testing, there is the chance that you'll end up with an extra playlist or test song in your library, but it should never destructively modify your library. If there is an error during testing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/issues/new) to let me know about it. You should also submit your gmusicapi.log.

###Getting Started

gmusicapi.api.Api is the user-facing interface. The provided example.py should be enough to get you started. For complete information, see the [documentation](http://readthedocs.org/docs/unofficial-google-music-api/en/latest). The testing code might also be useful.


##Ports

Here are the ports I'm currently aware of:

* C#: [Taylor Finnell](https://github.com/Byteopia/GoogleMusicAPI.NET)
* Java: [Jens Villadsen](https://github.com/jkiddo/gmusic.api) and [Nick Martin](https://github.com/xnickmx/google-play-client)
* PHP: [raydanhk](http://code.google.com/p/unofficial-google-music-api-php/)

###Porting Information for Developers

Get in touch if you're working on a port. Even if I can't contribute, I might know people who'd like to.

The current implementation uses the same interface that a web browser does, and a code overview can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/wiki/Codebase-Overview). Darryl Pogue is worked on a more durable implementation by emulating Google's Android app. His work is [here](https://github.com/dpogue/Unofficial-Google-Music-API), and may easier to port. More information this alternative protocol is [here](https://github.com/dpogue/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/wiki/Skyjam-API).

Either way, you'll probably want to ignore anything related to Music Manager; that's just for uploading. If uploading interests you, more information is [here](https://github.com/simon-weber/google-music-protocol).

Lastly, keep the license in mind, and, again, be sure to respect Google.



##Notes

Debug logging is enabled by default.
All logging is done to gmusicapi.log in your working directory, with warnings and above printed to the console.
Nothing related to authenticated gets logged aside from "logged in" and "logged out" messages.
